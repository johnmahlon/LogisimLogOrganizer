# LogisimLogOrganizer
Organizes the log output for Logisim for CSCI 3130 at MTSU.

I have supplied a C++ version that implements a List from the STL. 
Feel free to use this for Mac/*NIX.

Since I'm a Mac user, I'm not 100% sure how easy it is to compile and run C++ on Windows so.....

I rewrote this in Python 2.7 and added it here as well. Be sure to have Python 2.7 installed on your Windows computer before
use or else it won't work. Python 2.7 ships with Mac and Linux. 

Also, this is completely open source. Feel free to fork it, update it, add features, etc.
